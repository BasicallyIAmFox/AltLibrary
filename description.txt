Alternative Biomes Library is library mod to enable the creation of alternatives to various vanilla biomes and ores, without the need for complex IL editing knowledge.

This mod is used by developers to reduce the amount of repeated code involved in the process, as well as to ensure a baseline of compatibility between multiple mods that add alternates to vanilla content.
